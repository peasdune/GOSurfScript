# GOSurfScript

A client-side script for CS:GO to surf solo or with a lobby of friends (it will work for everyone in your lobby).

This will need to be extracted into your csgo/cfg folder. You can start the script after the map has loaded, preferably before team selection. To start, type "exec surf-guide" into your console.

Very briefly, the script will display your speed, ensure no damage and no collisions between players, it supports the "sm_back", "sm_stuck", "sm_start", "sm_restart" commands, or alternatively, you can look down and press your use key for stage reset or look up and press use for map reset. It will create spawn points on maps that don't have any, and it comes with several map-specific config files (extendable to your liking, if you can write scripts).
